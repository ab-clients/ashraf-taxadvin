          Our Story
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
          TaxAdvin was born from a simple idea: to provide Florida&apos;s
          individuals, small businesses and nonprofits with trustworthy,
          proactive guidance in the ever-changing world of tax and finance.
          After more than two decades of working across public and private
          sectors, our founder, Ashraf Abdeltawab, saw the need for a firm that
          couples deep technical expertise with genuine care for clients&apos;
          financial wellbeing. With a strong foundation in GAAP, financial
          accounting and strategic planning, Ashraf envisioned a service that
          would empower people to make sound decisions, minimise taxes and build
          lasting wealth.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          Today TaxAdvin serves clients throughout Florida with the same
          principles on which it was founded: professionalism, responsiveness,
          integrity and innovation. We are proud to contribute to our
          community&apos;s economic health by guiding our neighbours through
          everything from straightforward tax preparation to complex financial
          strategies.
